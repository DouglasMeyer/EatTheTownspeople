Eat The Townspeople

You are a monster in a medieval town, so what do you do? Eat the townspeople.


Townspeople will flee when they see a monster, but if they form a mob they can
kill it. Try to pick them off one at a time. If you get surrounded, you can roar
to scare them off; but everyone will know where you are.



 
Map:
  Black background with light box buildings. Roads/Buildings/Layout is randomly
  generated. Monster is placed randomly. Townspeople are placed randomly, but
  not too close to monster.
Input:

Gameplay:
